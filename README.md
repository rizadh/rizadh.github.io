# Personal Website

Just a website I use to host my web-based development projects. I have an emphasis on elegant, simple user interfaces and passion for pleasing motion design. It showcases the following projects.

## [Timer] (http://rizadh.github.io/timer.html)

Simple app to count down from a user inputted time. Supports quick-links to automatically start timing from a certain time as well as restoring a timer between sessions. Keyboard shortcuts are also implemented.

## [Clock] (http://rizadh.github.io/clock.html)

Modern, blue-themed analog clock. Displays current time and sports a very simplistic, sparse design. A notable design addition is the realistically simulated clock hand physics.

## [Stars] (http://rizadh.github.io/stars.html)

A fun side-project. Not functionally useful but an interesting exhibition of the power of JavaScript based animation. Can be used as an aribtrary benchmark of device graphic performance.

## [Home Page] (http://rizadh.github.io/index.html)

I left this all the way down here because ironically, this page has not been fully developed yet

## Planned Projects

**_Scheduler_** ~ Or _Schedulo_? Deciding on a name but will be an app geared towards students to help layout their weekly course timetables in an elegantly designed, white-based but colourful web app. Will allow for schedule overlaying to compare two different schedules

Have any ideas for me? Send me an [email to me!] (mailto:rizadh@icloud.com)
