# Personal Website

Just a website I use to host my web-based development projects. I have an emphasis on elegant, simple user interfaces and passion for pleasing motion design. It showcases the following projects.

### [Timer](http://rizadh.github.io/dist/timer.html)

Simple app to count down from a user inputted time. Supports quick-links to automatically start timing from a certain time as well as restoring a timer between sessions. Keyboard shortcuts are also implemented.

### [Clock](http://rizadh.github.io/dist/clock.html)

Modern, blue-themed analog clock. Displays current time and sports a very simplistic, sparse design. A notable design addition is the realistically simulated clock hand physics.

### [Clock (Canvas Edition)](http://rizadh.github.io/clock)

Second analog clock implementation using HTML5 Canvas instead of SVG graphics. Color theme is customizable by pressing and holding page!

### [Stars](http://rizadh.github.io/dist/stars.html)

A fun side-project. Not functionally useful but an interesting exhibition of the power of JavaScript based animation. Can be used as an arbitrary benchmark of device graphic performance.

### [Stars (Canvas Edition)](http://rizadh.github.io/stars)

Again, same as above, but using HTML5 Canvas instead of HTML `div` elements Should be a significant performance improvement.

### [Crimsons Studios](http://rizadh.github.io/dist/resources/crimson/)

My older site hosting a few older projects, the most notable being the countdown app.

### Planned Projects

**Scheduler** - Deciding on a name but will be an app geared towards students to help layout their weekly course timetables in an elegantly designed, white-based but colorful web app. Will allow for schedule overlaying to compare two different schedules.

Have any ideas for me? Send me an [email](mailto:rizadh@icloud.com)!
