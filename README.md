# Personal Website

This is just a website I use to showcase my web-based development projects:

## [Timer] (http://rizadh.github.io/timer.html)

Simple app to count down from a user inputted time. Supports quick-links to automatically start timing from a certain time as well as restoring a timer between sessions. Keyboard shortcuts are also implemented.

## [Clock] (http://rizadh.github.io/clock.html)

Modern, blue-themed analog clock. Displays current time and sports a very simplistic, sparse design. A notable design addition is the realistically simulated clock hand physics.

## [Stars] (http://rizadh.github.io/stars.html)

A fun side-project. Not functionally useful but an interesting exhibition of the power of JavaScript based animation. Can be used as an aribtrary benchmark of device graphic performance.
